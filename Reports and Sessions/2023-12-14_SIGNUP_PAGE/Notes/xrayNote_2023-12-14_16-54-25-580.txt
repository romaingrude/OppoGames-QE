Good: * AutoFill present for all input fields * Pre filled-in text instructions
* Hide Password working as expected Bad: * No username minimum length set (i.e.
“R” or “r” work) * 1 or more spaces are considered valid usernames * Spaces
inside password are validated (i.e. “1, Aa?\!£$%^&*()-=, ?”) * No email data
validation conditions in place (i.e. “roro”, “noemail” work, including empty
spaces “ ) * No email length limitation * No sign up confirmation alert or
message
