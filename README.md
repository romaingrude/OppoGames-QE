# Quality Engineering Final Project
This repository contains automated tests for a website developed as part of the final project for the Software Engineering course at Makers. The primary focus of the tests is on the core functionalities of login and signup, implemented using Java and Selenium. These tests are designed to verify the integrity and reliability of these critical features.

## Project Overview
This project was completed as the culminating assignment for the Quality Engineering course. The website was developed with the goal of providing a platform to practice and showcase software engineering skills. Given the constraints and time limitations during the final stages, the project was primarily focused on automating the login and signup processes. Due to time constraints, additional functionalities were tested manually.

## Key Features
Automated Tests: Written in Java using the Selenium framework.
Focus Areas: Login and signup functionalities.
Learning Experience
During this project, I gained valuable experience in setting up and executing automated tests using Selenium. I learned how to integrate Selenium with Java to create effective and maintainable test scripts. One of the main challenges was managing time effectively to balance both development and testing phases. The tight deadline required prioritizing essential features for automation and performing manual testing for the remaining functionalities.

## Challenges and Solutions
Time Constraints: The final stages of the project were rushed, leading to incomplete automation coverage. I addressed this by focusing on automating critical functionalities and ensuring thorough manual testing where necessary.
Test Automation Setup: Setting up the test environment and integrating Selenium required a learning curve. Through hands-on experimentation and research, I successfully configured the environment and implemented test cases.
This repository serves as a demonstration of my ability to develop and execute automated tests, providing insights into my approach to quality engineering and problem-solving under time constraints.
